If you see this you stumbeled upon the testing branch I would highly advise AGAINST taking configs from here
*My slightly cursed, sometimes working config files made from, official documentaion and all ready existing config repositories.*
GTK theme source: https://github.com/Fausto-Korpsvart/Gruvbox-GTK-Theme

I will provide no support no warranty no nothing. These are just my config files and I am offering you the possibility to see them and use them.
